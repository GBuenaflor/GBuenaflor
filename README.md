Hi There!, I'm GB, I'm an Engineer, Sr.Architect / Developer. I started as a Microsoft Stack Developer (.net, Azure) utilizing Windows and Linux OS. I'm also a Certified Electronics Engineer that program 8 and 16 Bit Microcontrollers in the past. Today I am spending most of my time designing and building microservices (under Microsoft Azure Container Ecosystem), implementing Azure Cloud Adoption Framework and migrations.
