---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

I'm a Sr. Architect with Enterprise-scale technical experience with cloud and hybrid infrastructures, architecture designs, migrations, and technology management. I work in two domains: cloud infrastructure solutions and cloud application development solutions. I started as a Microsoft Stack Developer (.net, Azure) utilizing Windows and Linux OS. Today I am spending most of my time designing and building microservices (under Microsoft Azure Container Ecosystem), designing Cloud Adoption Framework, landing zones, cloud migrations, and enterprise architecture using TOGAF, Zachman, and ITIL frameworks.
